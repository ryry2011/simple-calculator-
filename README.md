# Simple Calculator

## Project Description
This project is a simple calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition. The calculator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input two numbers and perform an addition operation. The result of the addition is displayed on the screen.

## Current Progress
- Designed and implemented the GUI using `tkinter`.
- Completed the functionality for the addition operation.

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring accurate input handling.
- Providing user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Next Steps
- Enhance the user interface for better usability.
- Add more arithmetic operations (subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Perform thorough testing and debugging.

## Usage
To use the Simple Calculator, run the application and input your desired arithmetic operation. The calculator will display the result on the screen.
